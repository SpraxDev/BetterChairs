# Contributing to BetterChairs
We love your input!
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same
[MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/SpraxDev/BetterChairs/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/SpraxDev/BetterChairs/issues/new/choose) – it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Make sure to provide all the relevant information needed to reproduce the bug you are reporting. You can upload logs, images or videos if needed.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
  * Be specific!
  * Give sample code if you can – Try to make it as universal as possible, so is quickly understood.
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* spaces for indentation rather than tabs

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at developer@sprax2013.de.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined
by other members of the project's leadership.
